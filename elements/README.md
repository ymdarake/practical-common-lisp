## SLIME commands
- `C-x C-e` evaluate at the ending parenthesis.
- `C-x o` next buffer.
- `C-x 0` close current window.
- `C-x 1` close all windows except the current one.
- `C-x 2` split the current window in two vertically.
- `C-x 3` split the current window in two horizontally.
- `C-x k` to kill the current buffer.
- `C-x b` to choose the buffer to focus on.
- `C-space` to start selection.
- `M-w` to copy.
- `C-w` to cut.
- `C-y` to paste.
- `M-;` to comment.
- `C-/` to undo.
- `C-c C-l` load the current file.
- `C-c C-c` compile.
- `C-c C-z` REPL.
- `,` on REPL and `quit` to close slime buffers. `M-x slime` to start SLIME.
- invoke error on REPL to dive into debugger mode. `q` to quit.
- `(load "/path/to/file")` to load file (on REPL).
- `M-p` to recall previous commands on REPL.

## Common Lisp syntax and semantics
- s-expression
  - list
  - atom
  - intern - package
- Reader
  - generating lisp objects called s-expression from text
- Evaluator
  - deciding valid lisp form
    - atoms and lists whose head is a symbol
    - atom
      - symbol(recognized as a name of a variable. and keyword symbol)
      - others(self-evaluating)
    - list
      - function call
        - (function0name *arguments) where each argument is as itself a lisp expression
      - special form
        - if
        - quote (')
        - let
      - macro
        - take an s-expression as an argument (s-expression is still not evaluated)
        - evaluate the form returned by the macro (in the ordinary way)
        - when compiled, all macro forms are extracted, but compiled code will not be evaluated until loaded
- true/false
  - `NIL` is the only value representing `false`. Others are all truthy.
  - empty list `()` is completely equivalent to `NIL`
  - standard value representing `true` is `t`
- equality
  - `eq`
    - comparing objects
    - comparing strings or int is dependent on processing system
  - `eql`
    - comparing objects
    - objects representing the same value are 'equal' if the objects' class are the same
  - `equal` and `equalp` ...
